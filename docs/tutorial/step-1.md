# Project Structure

For any new project, it is a good idea to start by laying out its structure ahead of time.
For this type of game, we will create the following files and directories.

- `assets`: a directory to hold images, music and so on.
- `data`: a directory to hold data files (not required for the tutorial, but recommended to develop the game further).
- `scenes`: the root directory where scenes will be stored.
- `scenes/battle`: a sub-directory to hold scenes related to battle only.
- `scripts`: a directory to hold general-purpose scripts, or scripts that are not tied to a particular scene (not required for this tutorial).
- `Test.tscn`: a test scene that will act as our main scene.
